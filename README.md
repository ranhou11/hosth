The benefits of working four days and resting three.
Enhance happiness and life satisfaction
The work system of working four days and resting three has been proven by many netizens and companies to significantly enhance employees' happiness and life satisfaction. This arrangement fills people's daily lives with anticipation and hope, whether it's going to work with a good mood after a break or looking forward to the upcoming holiday, which traps people in a virtuous cycle. Moreover, the fixed Wednesday off greatly improves many people's mental state and reduces Sunday night anxiety and discomfort.

Improve work efficiency and employee satisfaction
Although some people worry that reducing the workday would lead to lower productivity, in practice, many companies have found that flexible working arrangements do not affect office efficiency and can actually improve employee satisfaction. For example, James Liang, the co-founder of Trip.com Group, has said that the company is actively exploring more flexible four-day work weeks or shorter working hours as a way to maintain office efficiency while improving employee satisfaction.

Improve the balance between work and life
A work system with four days on and three days off helps employees better balance their work and family responsibilities. According to a survey, more than 70% of participants reported a decrease in burnout, 40% of respondents experienced improved sleep quality, and 54% of respondents found it easier to balance work and family responsibilities. This balance not only benefits individual health but also contributes to the overall well-being of society.

Innovation and flexibility
The innovation and flexibility of this working system have also been widely welcomed. Many netizens are even willing to accept a slight pay cut for the fixed holiday on Wednesdays. In addition, some companies have begun to try setting flexible working days to give employees more self-governed time. This practice not only saves commuting time but also provides employees with more freedom.

Social and Economic Impact
A work system with four days on and three days off is not only beneficial for individuals but may also have a positive impact on the entire society and economy. For example, it could promote the development of the tourism industry and other leisure sectors as people have more rest time to travel and enjoy entertainment. At the same time, such a system may attract more outstanding talents, thereby enhancing the competitiveness of enterprises.

In summary, the work system of working four days and resting three has shown numerous benefits in enhancing employee well-being, improving the balance between work and life, increasing efficiency, and raising employee satisfaction. Although there are still some challenges to fully promote this system, it undoubtedly provides a direction worth exploring for future labor reforms.
